                    <p class = "text-secondary">Let's get familiar with this particular washing machine</p>
                    <p>This washing machine interface gives a way to interact with the machine to adjust wash settings and begin washing clothes. In order to start the machine, the clothes should be loaded in, coins have to be entered in the coin slot, the knobs should be used to select a cycle and temperature, and the start button has to be pressed. Once the machine is started, the IN USE indicator light will turn on, and the indicator lights for the cycle steps will each turn. When the wash cycle is done, the DONE light will stay on until the top lid is opened to take clothes out.</p>

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p class = "text-secondary">Some key takeaways after observing and interviewing 3 laundry machine users</p>
            <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most people do not read the instructions below the lid before putting in their laundry.</li>
                <li>People tend to fill the laundry to the max.</li>
                <li>It takes around 6min/person to use the machine from approaching it to leaving.</li>
                <li>People tend to put in clothes before detergent, don&#x27t change the knobs, put coins in last, then press start.</li>
                <li>The laundry machine doesn&#x27t have a timer. All but one of the people observed set a timer on their phones after pressing start.</li>
                <li>Unloading the machines requires shorter people to jump to reach the bottom.</li>
                <li>Every person left the lid open after taking their clothes out.</li>

                    <h4>Questions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have you used another washing machine before using this one?</li>

                        <li>What factors determine for you if its is time to do laundry?</li>
                        <li>Walk me through your process using the washing machine from start to finish.</li>
                        <li>Is the machine done washing when you return to check on it?</li>
                        <li>Have you experienced any frustrations when operating the washing machine?

                        </li>   
                        <li>After using the washing machine, do you trust that your clothes are clean (no stains or smells)?

                    <h4>Summarized Responses</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Everyone has used another washing machine before that has had features missing in this machine including a timer, front-loading or clear door, quick wash setting, and beep when done.</li>
                        <li>Most people have a certain category of clothing that when it runs out, they need to do a load of laundry.</li>
                        <li>Some people trust that the machine cleans their clothes while some don&#x27t due to the fact that the machine looks old, and it is completely opaque, so you cannot see the clothes being cleaned.</li>
                        <li>Most people either use the normal or eco setting, don&#x27t adjust the temperature, set timers ranging from 30-50 minutes, then leave and come back to laundry that is done.</li>
                        <li>The main complaint about the laundry machine is it costs too much money to use.</li>
